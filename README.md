# Description

This Simple Portfolio Project is a basic web application that showcases a personal portfolio. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a practical example for learning Git commands and workflow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Saima223/Portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor or IDE.
4. Make changes to the project files (e.g., update content, styles, or add new features).
5. Stage your changes: `git add .`
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
7. Push your changes to the remote repository: `git push`

Feel free to experiment with other Git commands like branching and more. You can also explore different scenarios, such as resolving merge conflicts or undoing changes.
